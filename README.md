```

# DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents **sendscreen**, a Python program to continuously
capture and transmit the desktop to remote host over LAN (Local Area
Networking) using UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

**sendscreen** was developed to eliminate hassles at research meetings in our
laboratory.  At a meeting, participants bring their own laptops, and during a
meeting, they repeatedly (1) take the VGA/HDMI video cable connected to the
LCD projector, (2) plug the VGA/HDMI video connector to his/her laptop, (3)
enable the external video output (e.g., by pressing Fn + F7), (4) unplug the
VGA/HDMI video connector, and (5) pass it to another participant.  Such
awkward procedure had been endlessly performed during the meeting.  With
**sendscreen**, you no longer need to worry about the video cable and enabling
the external video output on your laptop.

**sendscreen** works either as a *sender* or a *receiver*.  
**sendscreen** works as a sender by default, and it repeatedly capture the
desktop and send the zlib-compressed image (frame) to the receiver.  When
invoked with `-r` option, **sendscreen** works as a *receiver*.  It waits for
incoming frame data over LAN.  When it receives the frame data from a sender,
the frame is uncompressed and displayed on the screen of the receiver.

# OPTIONS

- -v

  Verbose mode.  **sendscreen** will display additional information during
  execution.

- -r

  Receiver mode.  **sendscreen** receives frames from a sender in your LAN.

- -s host

  Specify receiver's hostname or IP address.

- -p port

  Port number at which the receiver receives frame data.

- -w width

  Specify the screen width (default: 800 [pixel]).

- -h height

  Specify the screen height (default: 600 [pixel]).

- -F rate

  Maximum frate rate is limited by *rate* (default: 10 [frame/s])

# REQUIREMENTS

  **sendscreen** runs on X Window System.  It uses Xlib and pygame modules as
    well as several Python standard modules.  **sendsceeen** asumes a TrueType
    font is available at `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf',
    which is included in fonts-freefont-ttf package in Debian GNU/Linux
    although **sendscreen** works with any TrueType font.

# INSTALLATION

```sh
$ pip3 install sendscreen
```

# AVAILABILITY

The latest version of **sendscreen** is available at PyPI
(https://pypi.org/project/sendscreen/) .
